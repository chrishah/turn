Wed May 23 14:54:42 UTC 2018	Number of unique solid k-mers (k=21): Ns = 69002812
Wed May 23 14:54:42 UTC 2018	Checking criterion: Ns / 4 ^ k < 0.0001 ..
Wed May 23 14:54:42 UTC 2018	69002812 / 4 ^ 21 = 1.56894229803584e-05 -> OK!
Wed May 23 14:54:42 UTC 2018	Will now search for the k-mer length at which the number of corrected bases is maximal
Wed May 23 14:54:42 UTC 2018	moving on to next k

Wed May 23 14:54:42 UTC 2018	Running bless with k=23
